Reflection:
This project was somewhat a challenge, having the structure of colors and fonts was a major issue to get correct, there was a lot of minor adjsutments that needed to be made to make the cite look even remotely good. I am also not great at design which make this project a bit of a fun challenge. 
I was also suprised by how quickly these files could get decently long and having comments about what each thing is was super important for working on this project over the weekend as it helped keep me remembering where I left off.
I faced some difficulties with formating and using new HTML methods for this project but I quickly got ahang of it and was able to quickly google to help fix my issues. I was also suprised how well copilot would autofill some of the information. The autofill got somewhat annoying near the end as it was trying to do the project for me but it started to recongize the color patterns I was using for the tables which was super nice for helping speed up my flow of the project.
Overall I enjoyed this project but it did take a good amount of time and the pre-class was also super long which make this homework somewhat stressful and a HUGE time commitement for this weekend.
